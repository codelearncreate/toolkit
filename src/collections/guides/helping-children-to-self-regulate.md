overviewSection: To support children's self-regulation during collaborative
  activities, ensure their basic needs are met before starting, such as having
  snacks or breaks. Prepare them ahead of time to reduce anxiety and
  frustration. Incorporate sensory activities into sessions, but be mindful of
  distractions, and provide a consistent set of sensory toys to promote
  familiarity and comfort.

## Description

Considering children’s well-being and engagement during collaborative activities can significantly impact their participation. There are several things you can consider to help children better self regulate during a collaborative activity.

## Suggestions

### Are the students’ basic needs met?

Design work should be completed only once students have had their basic needs met (had snack, lunch went to the washroom, had recess or a movement break prior to the session; not first thing in the morning, not at the end of day). 

### Have students been "briefed" ahead of time?

Preparing students ahead of time may eliminate anxiety and frustrations, allowing them to feel safe and calm with new or unfamiliar experiences. It is then that they may begin to show interest and ready for learning and contributing to creative expressions.

### How will all five senses be addressed in sessions?

Sensory Objects and ideas to incorporate it into the sessions may help students be engaged in sessions. There are various ways in which sensory objects can be introduced to students.

* Set aside 3 to 5 minutes for sensory time at the beginning of the session and remember to set the visual timer.
* Provide a small bin of sensory toys including squishy/ stress balls, small water bottles filled with sparkles and other interesting objects, books, small cars and animals, small handheld massagers. 
* Be mindful that musical toys and toys that create loud sounds may be distracting during sessions. 
* When selecting sensory objects for the bin, include objects that can be easily cleaned and washed/wiped down or sanitized.  
* Bring the same sensory bin to each session with the same and familiar toys. Slowly introduce a few toys at a time. You may find that as students become familiar with the structure and routine of the sessions. They will look for or ask for the same toys.
* Once the time is up, collect all sensory toys back in the bin. Some students may want/ need the sensory toys for a longer period of time - allowing them to do so, might help them feel calmer.
