## Description

Synthesizing results from collaborative sessions with children with disabilities requires a meticulous examination of their work and interactions. Unlike sessions with adults, generative activities are used to encourage creative thinking through games and interactive methods.

## Suggestions

### Examining Every Detail

Facilitators need to delve into each aspect of the children's work. For instance, discussing drawings in detail, exploring conversations during the drawing process, and understanding the rationale behind each element in the image. 

Undocumented interactions, like side conversations and expressions are essential for capturing a holistic understanding of a child's idea. This might involve using frameworks that can help researchers see beyond what is said, and focus on full body or multimodal expression/participation.

### Involving Teachers and Caregivers

Including teachers and caregivers whenever possible ensures a more comprehensive perspective of a child’s creative expression and they can provide you with insight that would have otherwise left unnoticed. 

### Sharing back the results

To keep children involved in this process, we may need to share the results from the activities with them. This would require a tangible and experiential medium, as written reports may not be accessible. Showcasing an improved or transformed product with their ideas implemented provides a meaningful way for them to perceive their impact and express further ideas about how to improve the work.

You can plan further collaborative activities that allow them to interact with the new features to express their feedback and validation.

### Empowering Children as Creative Partners

Treating children as creative partners in the design and development process fosters a continuous and iterative approach. Building lasting relationships with the children and their care network encourages ongoing collaboration, empowering children with disabilities to have a significant influence on a project's evolution.
